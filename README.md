# Unplanned Cesarean for non-reassuring fetal status by race-ethnicity manuscript

## Background

This is the repository housing all analytics for the manuscript currently titled "Association Between Race-Ethnicity and Unplanned Cesarean for Non-Reassuring Fetal Status." 

There is little history for this repository as the code was copied from a private parent repo in order to be made publicly available.

## Data

This code uses data clinically abstracted from the electronic health record by trained clinical data abstractors at 68 hospitals participating in the [Obstetrics Initiative](https://www.obstetricsinitiative.org/), a collaborative quality improvement project funded by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network.

These data are not publicly available.

## Code

The code in this repo is organized in numbered files that should be run in order. Code files do the following:
